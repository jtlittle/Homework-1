                    <p>Hi, I’m Jay Little! I’m a Seattle native and have lived in the PNW for over 25 years. At the
                        moment, I’m a student at the UW Coding Bootcamp where I’m learning to be a Web Developer. Some
                        of the skills I’m picking up are: javascript, HTML and CSS. In my former life and career, I
                        worked in HR at Amazon and Microsoft for over 15 years.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’ve a lot of hobbies besides building webpages. I’m a former college athlete in Swimming and
                        Water Polo and I remain active in my spare time. I run often and snowboard in the winters. I
                        also try to keep up with my lively Golden Retriever named Rainier! I do a lot of travel around
                        the PNW and I love getting outdoors. I camp and hike in the summers. I like to ride my bicycle.
                        Best of all, I got married in Oct 2019 to my beautiful wife, Meg!
